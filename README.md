Included in the module are a readme, data set and python script

This module looks at energy usage by type of service/building and by two service providers 
using a data set from the site: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/uedp-fegm/rows.csv


This data set is used to determine consumption median, mean and standard deviation and accurately compare. 
First the data was imported, and dataframe set up. Then the dataframe was looked at, filtered and separate 
dataframes set up to look at each type of service and then each utility provider. The median energy consumption
in GJ was computed for each type of building service, and the mean and standard deviation were computed for 
each of the utility providers.
